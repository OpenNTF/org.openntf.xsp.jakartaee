# To-Do Examples

This directory contains four examples of the same basic To-Do tracker application written four ways, using different combinations of Domino and XPages JEE technologies.

* [`xpages`] contains a version of the app that primarily uses "traditional" XPages technologies: normal controls, themes, and all that. The main JEE technology it brings in is Jakarta NoSQL, which handles the actual data access. To bridge from XPages to the CDI-based NoSQL, it uses a "controller" class to house the logic from the XPages and an app-scoped bean to connect it all.
* [`rest`] contains a version of the app that is focused on writing REST resources using JAX-RS. It contains near-identical NoSQL code in the `model` package and then contains a JAX-RS resource in the `rest` package. It contains a perfunctory HTML+JS application inside the file resources: in practice, this would often be an npm-based JavaScript client app or another server reaching the data.
* [`mvc`] contains a version of the app that uses Jakarta MVC with Jakarta Pages to render the UI. Again, the model layer is similar, and much of the remaining Java code is similar to the REST example, albeit with code in the `controller` package. This contains JSP files inside file resources for the UI.
* [`faces`] contains a version of the app that uses Jakarta Faces. The structure of this one is most similar to the XPages, but with the XPages components replaced with stock JSF components and HTML. There's one fewer layer in the Java side, as there's a bit less bridging going on.

These modes of development were discussed on [my blog in July 2023](https://frostillic.us/blog/posts/2023/7/28/modes-of-app-development-with-xpages-jakarta-ee) and formed the basis for the latter half of my [OpenNTF presentation from August 2023](https://youtu.be/yPeq9BPhGmE).
